# aqua-vault
A cool underwater survival game.
Developped by rpaparov and jc-lemalin.


Prologue:

The year is 2358, the world as we know it is gone, massive amounts of water now covers
the planet Earth... it literally has became the Blue Planet. All air-breating creatures
are extinct except for a few million humains which have survived the World
Terror I and II (WT I-II). Small societies were created on the water surface, living on
floating cites. Past human errors drove the societies to follow strict rules, and those
who dared bend them were sent in underwater vault in small communities as a 
life punishement and setting the example for others. These underwater exiled were 
doomed to adapt to this aquatic ecosystem at the mercy of overpopulated sea creatures.
They would unite and trade or perish alone in dark sea depths.

Here is how it all started...

Chapter I:
As it has being foretold by nowadays scientists, climate change was at our door... a big
clash was inevitable. In 2052 a major cataclysme (World Terror I) (TODO What 
is it gulf stream? TODO) affected the planet, fire and destruction was seen
everywere, tornados, typhons, etc. As solution, the worlds best scientists were gatered 
at the Harvard University and started to build several hydrogen reactors capable of
regulating locally the planet's water concentration and temperature, thus creating 
liveble microclimates. Benefits were quickly seen as almost normal temperature
conditions were recovered in these artificial quiet areas. For several year, a lull 
was gratefully welcome, since billions have died during the first disaster.

Chapter II:
Cities were rebuild and societies were getting organised. The human were once 
again in control of their own faith. During this period, for many humans compassion
and hopes changed to darker thoughts, since the climatic treat was gone. 
It has been told that a particular madman greed dive the human race in the World 
Terror II. His name was Caisa Wonten, a pencil pushing rat lab working at Harvard
Laboratory. Part of a newly formed extremist group, called EXW2G (EXtreme Wrong for
Greater Greed). He was mandated to steal one of cities reactor in order to blackmail
the united governements of the world of closing the reactor otherwise they would need 
to pay. (TODO explain better TODO)When the plan was carried out, in the process, 
the reactor entered in an unstopable cycle generating continuous amount of water.
After, nearly 20 years the chain reaction of the reactors flooded every
continents pushing the humans to new horizons.


Chapter III:
After WT-II a few million survived and managed to build floating cities.
Strict rules were established.
Wrongdoers were sent in vaults on the seabed.


Storyline:

Small tribes of exiled have been formed, but only by trading will they be able to survive.
