# aqua-vault
An underwater survival game.

The year is 2358, the world as we know it is gone, massive amounts of water now covers
planet Earth... it literally has become the Blue Planet. All air-breathing creatures
are extinct except for a few million humans which have survived the World
Terror I and II. Small societies were created on the water surface, living on
floating cities. Past human errors drove the societies to follow strict rules, and those
who dared bend them were sent in underwater vault of small communities as a 
life punishment, setting the example for others. These underwater exiles were 
doomed to adapt to this aquatic ecosystem at the mercy of overpopulated sea creatures.
You are called to command a small gang to survive in an underwater vault.
You shall expand and trade or perish alone in dark sea depths.

Storyline:

Here is how it all started...

As it has been foretold by nowadays scientists, climate change was at our door... a big
clash was inevitable. In 2052 a major cataclysm (World Terror I) generating sequences of
natural disasters in every corner of the planet, fire and destruction was seen everywhere.
As solution, the worlds best scientists were gathered at the Harvard University and 
started to build several hydrogen reactors capable of regulating locally the planet's 
water concentration and temperature, thus creating liveable micro-climates. 
Benefits were quickly seen as almost normal temperature conditions were recovered in 
these artificial quiet areas. For several year, a lull was gratefully welcome, since 
billions have died during the first natural disaster.

Cities were rebuilt and societies were getting organized. The human were once 
again in control of their own faith. Though during this period, for many humans 
compassion and hopes changed for darker thoughts since the climatic treat was gone. 
It has been told that a particular madman greed dive the human race in the World 
Terror II. His name was Caisa Wonten, a pencil-pushing lab-rat working at Harvard
Laboratory. Part of a newly formed extremist group, called EXW2G (EXtreme Wrong for
Greater Greed). He was mandated to steal one of cities reactor in order to blackmail
for money the united governments of the world of closing the reactor. The night the 
plan was carried out, in the process, the reactor entered in an unstoppable cycle 
generating continuous amount of water. After nearly 20 years the chain reaction
generated enough water to flood every continents, pushing the humans to new horizons.

After WT-II, a few million survived and managed to build floating cities. The governments
established strict rules in order to limit the number of human deviations. Wrongdoers 
were sent in small vaults on the seabed. Punished to survived in an aquatic perilous
world.
